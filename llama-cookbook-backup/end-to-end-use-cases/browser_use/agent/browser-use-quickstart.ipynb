    "# üåê Building an Intelligent Browser Agent with Llama 4\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to creating an AI-powered browser agent capable of navigating and interacting with websites autonomously. By combining the power of Llama 4 Scout, Playwright, and Together AI, this agent can perform tasks seamlessly while understanding both visual and textual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Demo\n",
    "For a detailed explanation of the code and a demo video, visit our blog post: [**Blog Post and Demo Video**](https://miguelg719.github.io/browser-use-blog/)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Features\n",
    "- Visual understanding of web pages through screenshots\n",
    "- Autonomous navigation and interaction\n",
    "- Natural language instructions for web tasks\n",
    "- Persistent browser session management\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can ask the agent to:\n",
    "- Search for a product on Amazon\n",
    "- Find the cheapest flight to Tokyo\n",
    "- Buy tickets for the next Warriors game\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What's in this Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "This recipe walks you through:\n",
    "- Setting up the environment and installing dependencies.\n",
    "- Automating browser interactions using Playwright.\n",
    "- Defining a structured prompt for the LLM to understand the task and execute the next action.\n",
    "- Leveraging Llama 4 Scout for content comprehension.\n",
    "- Creating a persistent and intelligent browser agent for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Please note that the agent is not perfect and may not always behave as expected.**\n",

    "   - Placeholders: \"placeholder=Search...\"\n",
    "   - Link: \"link=BUY NOW\"\n",
    "3. Use **\"fill\"** for inputting text into editable fields. Examples:\n",
    "   - Placeholder: \"placeholder=Search...\"\n",
    "   - Textbox: \"textbox=Flight destination output\"\n",
    "   - Input: \"input=Search...\"\n",
    "4. Use **\"finished\"** when the task is done. For example:\n",
    "   - If a task is successfully completed.\n",
    "   - If navigation confirms you are on the correct page.\n",
